# SIMPLEPERF

Simpleperf is a program based on the iPerf tool for measuring network throughput. This program is a simplified network throughput measurement tool. simpleperf sends and recieves packets of 1000 bytes between a client and a server using sockets. It runs in two modes: Server mode and client mode.

## Dependencies
This program uses [PrettyTable](https://pypi.org/project/prettytable/) as a dependency.
To install via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/):

```
python -m pip install -U prettytable
```

If **ModuleNotFoundError** try instead to install the tarball prettytable-3.6.0.tar.gz in this repository:
```
sudo pip install ./prettytable-3.6.0.tar.gz
```
*You might have to run with --force-reinstall for this to work*

### Troubleshooting:

I sometimes had some difficulties running PrettyTable in xterm. For the most part, just importing it with the tarball did the trick. However, sometimes I had to just purge pip completely and start over.

```
sudo apt-get --purge autoremove python3-pip
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

 I don't know if it works best to install pip and the library right in xterm or in bash terminal, but I would try both approaches if it doesn't work. I would also check if there are a more recent version than 3.6.0 and download a new tarball if it is giving you trouble. After some purging and cursing it have always worked for me.

## How to run
Simpleperf runs in server and client mode. Each mode have different flags you can invoke.

**To get the full list of every flag you can run:**

```
python simpleperf.py -h
```

&nbsp;

**To run server mode with default values:**
```
python simpleperf.py -s
```
*Will run the server on 127.0.0.1:8088 printing in MB format.* 

&nbsp;

**To run the client mode with default values:**
```
python simpleperf.py -c
```
*Will run the client with 127.0.0.1:8088 as server, printing in MB format and run for 25 seconds.*

### **Table below lists all the available options that you can use to invoke the server:**

| -b       | --bind        | ip adress   | string    | allows to select the ip address of the server’s interface where the client should connect - use a default value if it’s not provided. It must be in the dotted decimal notation format, e.g. 10.0.0.2 |
| -p       | --port        | port number | integer   | allows to use select port number on which the server should listen; the port must be an integer and in the range [1024, 65535], default: 8088                                                         |
| -f       | --format      | MB          | string    | allows you to choose the format of the summary of results - it should be either in B, KB or MB, default=MB)
